Sfotm's Dotfiles
=================

This is a repository used for keeping my dotfiles up to date with [Dotbot][dotbot].

Info
----

To keep submodules at their proper versions, you could include something like
`git submodule update --init --recursive` in your `install.conf.yaml`.

To upgrade your submodules to their latest versions, you could periodically run
`git submodule update --init --remote`.
